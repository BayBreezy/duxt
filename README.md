## Modules Used

- @nuxt/content
- nuxt-icon
- @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
- @vueuse/nuxt
- nuxt-lodash
- nuxt-headlessui

Thanks to all the maintainers of these modules 🙏.

The styling might look familiar to you, that's because it's copied from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Thanks.

Thinking about making some components in another project based on the ones from shadcn/ui.
